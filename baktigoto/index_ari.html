                                <p>I worked with the Thomson Reuters Market development team on two projects to further engage our already existing Clients and also reach out to potential Clients. These projects involved simulations and experientals that tapped into the pyschology of human tendency for emulation as well as a need to understand and know why, what, where and how things work. In addition to this, I also did some work on New Business Research which entails looking at a list of companies in various industries and carrying out research on them to see how Thomson Reuters solutions might be valuable to them. </p><!-- caption -->
